# circuitpython-programs
A collection of programs I use on various CircuitPython devices. Most of these files are just a scratchpad for the final project files.

### Audioreactive Featherwing
File: `code.py`

A rp2040 Feather with a Neopixel Feather and digital microphone.  The pixels move based on the sound using a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT).

### MacroPad
My macros for my Adafruit MacroPad including Audacity, Safari, Onshape, and more.

### MatrixPortal AlbumArt
Abandoned project to display album art on a 64x64 LED matrix.

### Pillow
Test scripts to manipulate images using Python.

### PyPortal Album Art
File: `pyportal-albumart.py`

Using a PyPortal Titano, when I am logged into my website, silversaucer.com, I can have the site pick a random record.  That record's cover art is then displayed on the PyPortal.
