# circuitpython-programs
A collection of programs I use on various CircuitPython devices. Most of these files are just a scratchpad for the final project files.

## Tips.md
A [collection of tips and tricks for CircuitPython](tips.md), inspired by [todbot](https://github.com/todbot/circuitpython-tricks).

## Projects & Code

### Audioreactive Featherwing
File: `code.py`

A rp2040 Feather with a Neopixel Feather and digital microphone.  The pixels move based on sound using a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). Learn more at its [project page](https://github.com/prcutler/speakerstand-lights/blob/main/pictures/neopixel-feather.gif) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/prcutler/speakerstand-lights).

### MacroPad
File: `code.py` (no changes from the default Adafruit project)

`/macros`: My macros for my Adafruit MacroPad including Audacity, Safari, and more.

### MatrixPortal AlbumArt
Abandoned project to display album art on a 64x64 LED matrix.

### Pillow
Test scripts to manipulate images using Python.

### PyPortal Album Art
File: `pyportal-albumart.py` (Rename to `code.py` if using)

Using a PyPortal Titano, when I am logged into my website, silversaucer.com, I can have the site pick a random record.  That record's cover art is then displayed on the PyPortal.  Includes a number of scratchpad files, including a non-working version using MQTT and the `PyPortal` class.  (They work individually, but not together.)
